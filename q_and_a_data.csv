scientifically,chromosomes,Do trans women have male chromosomes?,"Chromosomes are effectively ""assigned"" at conception, and which chromosomes a person has cannot be changed. However, many people assigned male at birth have XX chromosomes, and many asigned female have XY: this is a lot more common than you may think, and people who teach advanced biology rarely have strudents test their own chromosomes to avoid--often distressing--suprises! Nonbinary identies aren't inherently linked to biology, and nonbinary peoples' chromosomes are irrelivent to their identity (as they ultimately are to any of us.)","Do trans people change chromosomes,Do trans women have xy chromosomes,Do trans men have xx chromosomes,Do trans women have xx chromosomes,Do trans men have xy chromosomes,Do nonbinary people have the same chromosomes"
as criminals,predation,Do men pretend to be trans to access womens' bathrooms?,"No. While a man *may* decide to put on a dress to sneak into a womens' bathroom, that is not the same as ""pretending to be trans."" It's just cross-dressing. Of course, if a man wanted to enter a women's bathroom to spy on or assault women, he'd just walk in and do it. He wouldn't upend and endanger his entire life first. There have been no reported cases of trans women assaulting cis women in public spaces.","Do trans women assault women in bathrooms,Do people pretend to be trans to assault women in bathrooms"
